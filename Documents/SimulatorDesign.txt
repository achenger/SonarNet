So I am looking over the sim I used for 581. For this work I need it
to do different things:

1) I need more flexible beam pattern computation. These should be
table driven, a composite of in-plane and normal components as if from
planar arrays. For now let's wrap the array and beam pattern into one
function. Need this for both transmit and receive. Let's see if I can
get the stuff from the office for this.

We have the stuff from the office. Let me verify that as best I can quickly. 

2) I need real backscattering functions. Let's use the table driven
versions. These can be mono-static models for now.

3) Need target models so we wil need a funciton to return lists of
point scatterers. We will be testing the ability of the CNN to
differentiate compact and distributed targets.

4) For now we limit ourselves to CW pulses, planar square arrays, and
line-targets.

5) Wondering if filtered noise (K-w) or point-scatterer reverb is best.

6) Wondering about multi-path.
